FCC A Sky Full of Stars

Incorporating Astropy and Astroplan to plot constellations based on the angles right ascension and declination using matplotlib, SkyCoord, plot_sky, FixedTarget, Observer and failed attempts at Skyfield, Moonphase, pandas (data manipulation) and Beautiful Soup to access wikitables. 

Please Downloard Constellations.csv to your google drive before continuing to plot 

Still a work in progress, much potential in completing it someday
